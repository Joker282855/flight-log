# Title:
Flight Log

# Description:
This is a database that ariline companies can use to log thier flights and destination of each flight. 
Airlines can use this database to add additional flights, remove flights, and forecast the weather of each
flight. People who use this flight log can pull up all of the information associated with each airline and 
modify the information on the databse through get, post, put, and delete routes. Routes tell the computer
wehre to get information from the database itself. 

# Tasks:
1. As a user I can post the names of each airline that is currently at the airport.
2. As a user I can pull up every airline that is at the airport.
3. As a user I can post where the airline is going, its price, and how many flights each airline has
4. As a user I can post the state of the weather where each ariline is going. 
5. As a user I can use the different routes to show all of the data put into the database.
6. As a user I can use the routes to modify the data as needed. 

# Tasks Achieved By: 
I was able to do all of these tasks by reviewing previous databases that I had made in the past and use them as guides while creating this database. Looking at my old projects from 
the bootcamp was a big help in making this database from scratch. I also reviewed the old lesson material the bootcamp at Utah University used to teach my cohort. Reviewing the old
lesson material also helped me remeber what steps are needed to create a database.
