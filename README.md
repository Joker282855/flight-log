# Title:
Flight Log

# Description:
This is a database I created as a way to practice my aility to create relational databases. This ddatabases uses the language of SQL primarily and was based on creating a log
for different airlines. The price, quantity, and where the airline is going is what makes up the data for this database. Users have the ability to pull up all of the
information associated with each airline and modify the information on the databse through get, post, put, and delete routes. 

# Tasks:
1. As a user I can post the names of each airline that is currently at the airport.
2. As a user I can pull up every airline that is at the airport.
3. As a user I can post where the airline is going, its price, and how many flights each airline has
4. As a user I can post the state of the weather where each ariline is going. 
5. As a user I can use the different routes to show all of the data put into the database.
6. As a user I can use the routes to modify the data as needed. 

# Tasks Achieved By: 
I was able to do all of these tasks by reviewing previous databases that I had made in the past and use them as guides while creating this database. Looking at my old projects from 
the bootcamp was a big help in making this database from scratch. I also reviewed the old lesson material the bootcamp at Utah University used to teach my cohort. Reviewing the old
lesson material also helped me remeber what steps are needed to create a database.
